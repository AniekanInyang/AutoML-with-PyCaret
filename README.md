# AutoML-with-PyCaret

AutoML is a field where the entire machine learning process is abstracted with very little to no code input by a human (machine learning engineer or data scientist). PyCaret is a Python library used for AutoML.

In this repository, I use PyCaret to solve a binary classification problem, experimenting with different algorithms (Decision trees, Random forest, KNN, Extra trees), evaluating the models, and saving the final model. 

The dataset used is the employee dataset, one of the sample datasets provided by PyCaret.

#### Required version:
- Python 3
